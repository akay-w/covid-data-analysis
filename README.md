This is a project that I did for a class on edX (Python for Data Science from UC San Diego).
I did a brief analysis of the Covid-19 infection/mortality data provided by the New York Times, with a focus on Central New Jersey.

Data source: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

My analysis was based on the data as of July 31, 2020.
I also used the following page on Kaggle as reference:
